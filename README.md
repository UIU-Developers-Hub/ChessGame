# ChessGame
A Simple Chess Game implemented in Java using JavaFX

# Overview :
This is a basic implementation of a Chess game using JavaFX. The game allows two players to play against each other on the same machine. The game includes basic features such as piece movement, capturing, and check/checkmate detection.

# Features
Basic piece movement and capturing
Check and checkmate detection
Promotion of pawns to queen, rook, bishop, or knight
Simple game loop with animation
# How to Play
Run the game by executing the HelloApplication class.
The game will start with a new board and pieces.
Players take turns clicking on a piece to select it, and then clicking on a square to move it to.
The game will detect checks and checkmates, and alert the players accordingly.
The game will also handle promotions and castling.
# Technical Details
The game is implemented using JavaFX for the GUI and game loop.
The game logic is implemented in the GamePanel class.
The game uses a simple animation timer to update the game state and render the board.
The game pieces are implemented as separate classes, each with their own movement and capturing logic.
# Future Development
This is a basic implementation of a Chess game, and there are many features that could be added to make it more complete. Some ideas for future development include:

Implementing en passant and castling rules
Adding a timer and scoring system
Implementing a more advanced AI for computer opponents
Creating a multiplayer mode using network sockets or a game server
